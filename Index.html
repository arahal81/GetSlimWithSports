        <h3> Basketball</h3>, game played between two teams of five players each on a rectangular court, usually
        indoors.
        Each team tries to score by tossing the ball through the opponent’s goal, an elevated horizontal hoop and
        net called a
        basket.

            The only major sport strictly of U.S. origin, basketball was invented by James Naismith (1861–1939) on or
            about December 1, 1891, at the International Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA) Training School (now
            Springfield College), Springfield, Massachusetts, where Naismith was an instructor in physical education.

            For that first game of basketball in 1891, Naismith used as goals two half-bushel peach baskets, which gave
            the sport its name. The students were enthusiastic. After much running and shooting, William R. Chase made a
            midcourt shot—the only score in that historic contest. Word spread about the newly invented game, and
            numerous associations wrote Naismith for a copy of the rules, which were published in the January 15, 1892,
            issue of the Triangle, the YMCA Training School’s campus paper.

        <h3>History</h3>
        <h4> The early years</h4>
        In the early years the number of players on a team varied according to the number in the class and the size of
        the
        playing area. In 1894 teams began to play with five on a side when the playing area was less than 1,800 square
        feet
        (167.2 square metres); the number rose to seven when the gymnasium measured from 1,800 to 3,600 square feet
        (334.5
        square metres) and up to nine when the playing area exceeded that. In 1895 the number was occasionally set at
        five by
        mutual consent; the rules stipulated five players two years later, and this number has remained ever since.

            Since Naismith and five of his original players were Canadians, it is not surprising that Canada was the
            first country
            outside the United States to play the game. Basketball was introduced in France in 1893, in England in 1894,
            in
            Australia, China, and India soon thereafter, and in Japan in 1900.
